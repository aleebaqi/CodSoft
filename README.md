# CodSoft Internship AI Tasks

Welcome to my repository for the CodSoft Internship Artificial Intelligence tasks. Here, you will find implementations for three different tasks showcasing various aspects of artificial intelligence.

## 1. Rule-Based Chatbot in Python

### Overview
This task focuses on developing a simple rule-based chatbot in Python. The chatbot responds to user input based on predefined rules and patterns.

### Usage
- Run the chatbot script in a Python environment.
- Enter text input, and the chatbot will respond based on the implemented rules.

## 2. Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Minimax

### Overview
This task involves creating an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures optimal moves to maximize its chances of winning or achieve a draw.

### Usage
- Run the Tic-Tac-Toe AI script in a Python environment.
- Play the game against the AI and experience its strategic decision-making using the Minimax algorithm.

## 3. Simple Recommendation System

### Overview
The recommendation system demonstrates collaborative filtering for suggesting items to users based on their preferences. It utilizes the Surprise library in Python.

### Usage
- Run the recommendation system script in a Python environment.
- Customize the provided data or replace it with your own dataset for personalized recommendations.
- Explore the collaborative filtering algorithm and its output.

## Repository Structure
